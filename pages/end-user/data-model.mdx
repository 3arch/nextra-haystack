# Overview of the Data Model

Project Haystack uses a data model that is based on tags, entities, and relationships. In this section, we'll provide an overview of the core concepts of the data model and explain how to use the different types of tags.

## Tags

A tag is a key-value pair that is used to describe a property of an entity. In Project Haystack, tags are used to describe the properties of entities such as equipment, points, and services.

## Entities

An entity is an object that is described by one or more tags. In Project Haystack, entities represent physical or logical objects such as equipment, points, and services.

## Relationships

Relationships are used to describe how different entities are connected. In Project Haystack, relationships are used to describe how different entities are connected, such as how a piece of equipment is connected to a point.
