# Understanding Vocabulary, Taxonomy, and Ontology in Project Haystack

Project Haystack, an open-source initiative, provides a common data model and encoding format for building automation and industrial control systems. One of the key aspects of the project is the use of vocabulary, taxonomy, and ontology to organize and label the data in a consistent and meaningful way.

## Vocabulary

Vocabulary refers to the set of terms used to describe the data in a system. In Project Haystack, a standardized vocabulary is used to describe the data, allowing for more consistent and accurate data analysis, as well as improved data visualization and reporting.

For example, in a building automation system, the standardized vocabulary used by Project Haystack includes terms such as "temp" for temperature, "status" for the status of equipment, and "kWh" for kilowatt-hours. This ensures that data is consistently labeled and easy to understand.

## Taxonomy

Taxonomy refers to the hierarchical structure used to organize the data in a system. In Project Haystack, a standardized taxonomy is used to organize the data, making it easier to filter and search for specific data.

For example, in a building automation system, the taxonomy used by Project Haystack includes a hierarchical structure with levels such as "site", "building", "floor", and "equipment". This allows users to easily navigate and filter the data by location.

## Ontology

Ontology refers to the additional information used to provide context to the data in a system. In building automation and industrial control systems, semantic tagging is used to provide additional information, such as the relationships and associations between different data points. This provides more context to the data, making it easier to understand and work with.

For example, in a building automation system, the ontology used might include relationships such as airRef and elecRef, which link the data for air temperature and electricity usage, respectively. This allows for more accurate data analysis, as the relationship between different data points can be easily understood.
