# Welcome to Project Haystack

## The open source initiative to develop a common data model and tagging conventions for building automation and industrial control systems.

As an end user, you may be new to the concepts and terminology used in this project. In this guide, we will introduce you to some key concepts that will help you understand how Project Haystack organizes and manages data. One of the first concepts to understand is the difference between vocabulary, taxonomy, and ontology. 

**Vocabulary** is a set of words and terms used to describe a particular subject or domain. In Project Haystack, the vocabulary consists of a set of tags that are used to describe the various components of a building automation or industrial control system.

**Taxonomy** refers to the way in which these tags are organized and grouped. In Project Haystack, the taxonomy is based on the hierarchical relationships between tags, with more general terms at the top of the hierarchy and more specific terms at the bottom.

**Ontology** is concerned with the relationships and associations between the tags. In Project Haystack, the ontology describes the ways in which tags can be related to one another, such as the relationship between a sensor and the piece of equipment it is measuring.

Project Haystack then uses **relationships** and **associations** to connect vocabulary together. Relationships describe the hierarchical relationships between tags, while associations describe the relationships between tags that are not based on hierarchy.

By understanding these concepts and the way they are used in Project Haystack, you will be better equipped to navigate and make sense of the data in your building automation or industrial control system.
