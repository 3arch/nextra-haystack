## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Haystack defines the fundamentals for modeling data centers via the [dataCenter](dataCenter) and [rack](rack) tags.  Data centers are considered a specialized type of [space](space). Equipment and devices contained within the data center define their relationship to the data center via the [spaceRef](spaceRef) tag.

## <a name="racks"></a>Racks

Racks are modeled as specialized [equip](equip) with the [rack](rack) marker tag.  The servers and networking gear contained by the rack declare their containment relationship via the [equipRef](equipRef) tag.

## <a name="examples"></a>Examples

Here is a simple example for a data center containing one rack that contains one server:

    id: @dc
    dis: "Simple Data Center"
    dataCenter
    space
    siteRef: @site
    
    id: @rack1
    dis: "Rack-1"
    rack
    equip
    spaceRef: @dc
    siteRef: @site
    
    id: @server-1A
    dis: "Rack-1 Server-A"
    server
    computer
    device
    rackRef: @rack1
    spaceRef: @dc
    siteRef: @site
