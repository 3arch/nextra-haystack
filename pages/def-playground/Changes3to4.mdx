## <a name="weather"></a>Weather

In Haystack 3, weather stations were modeled via the `weather` tag, and their points were modeled via the `weatherPoint` tag.  In Haystack 4, we use the [weather](weather) marker on the points as the [pointSubject](pointSubject).  And stations are modeled via the [weatherStation](weatherStation) tag.  Likewise, the `weatherRef` tag is now renamed to `weatherStationRef`.

Weather points are mapped from Haystack 3 to Haystack 4 as follows:

    Haystack 3            Haystack 4             Notes
    -------------------   --------------------   ------------------------
    weatherCond           weatherCond            same

    wetBulb temp          air wetBulb            pair with air not temp
    apparent temp         air feelsLike          renamed, pair with air not temp
    dew temp              air dewPoint           pair with air not temp
    humidity              air humidity           pair with air

## <a name="lighting"></a>Lighting

Most tags related to lighting have not been included pending the work under [WG 705](https://project-haystack.org/forum/topic/705)

## <a name="networks"></a>Networks

Haystack 3 included a prototype for modeling networks, devices, and connections between them.  It was never implemented by any vendors and was not complete, so it has not been ported to Haystack 4.  However, some of the core concepts are found in the `phIct` library including:

* [network](network)
* [device](device)
* [protocol](protocol)


## <a name="symbols"></a>Symbols

Symbol is added as a new scalar type in Haystack 4.  In Zinc, it is represented as `^name` and in JSON with the "y:" prefix.  The format version was left as "3.0" to minimize ecosystem disruption since symbols are only used with defs and unlikely to occur in normal Haystack data.
