Equipment assets are modeled with the [equip](equip) marker tag.  Equipment is often a physical asset such as an air handler, boiler, chiller, or meter. However, equip can also be used to model a logical grouping such as an entire chilled water plant.

## <a name="tags"></a>Tags

Equip entities must define a [siteRef](siteRef) tag for their parent site. Additionally, use the [spaceRef](spaceRef) tag if the equipment is contained by a defined space.  It is also typical to nest equipment using containment via the [equipRef](equipRef) tag.  For example, if a fan is contained by an AHU, then the fan entity should define an `equipRef` that references the parent AHU entity.

Here are examples for the proper tagging of equipment:

    // electric meter for a building
    id: @site.mainMeter
    dis: "Main Elec Meter"
    ac
    elec
    meter
    equip
    siteMeter
    siteRef: @site
    spaceRef: @site.utility-closest
    
    // chilled water plant
    id: @site.chillerPlant
    dis: "Chiller Plant"
    chilled
    water
    plant
    equip
    siteRef: @site
    
    // chiller contained by plant from previous example
    id: @site.chiller3
    dis: "Chiller-3"
    chiller
    equip
    siteRef: @site
    equipRef: @site.chillerPlant
