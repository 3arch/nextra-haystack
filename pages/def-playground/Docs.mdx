## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This chapter provides guidance on how to use the reference documentation. Each section used in the documentation is described below.

## <a name="index"></a>Index

The main index page is composed of the following sections:

### <a name="taxonomies"></a>Taxonomies

This section lists key terms with a link to an index of the term's subtype tree.  You can add new terms into this section with the [docTaxonomy](docTaxonomy) tag.

### <a name="listings"></a>Listings

This section contains links to miscellaneous listing pages including:

* `tags`: all terms composed of an atomic name
* `conjuncts`: all terms composed of multiple tags
* `libs`: listing of library modules
* `filetypes`: listing of Haystack filetype encodings


### <a name="tags-index"></a>Tags

Section within a lib index that lists the terms defined by the lib module (both atomic tags and conjuncts).

## <a name="manuals"></a>Manuals

Manuals are hand written documents that provide design details to augment the auto-generated reference documentation.  Manuals are composed of chapters that correspond to individual HTML pages.

A manual index is composed of two sections:

* manual: summary information including name and brief overview
* chapters: index of the manual's chapter pages


## <a name="defs"></a>Defs

Each def has its own reference page in the documentation composed of the following sections:

### <a name="def"></a>Def

The `def` section contains summary information for the definition including its identifier formatted [doc](doc) description.

### <a name="conjunct"></a>Conjunct

This section is used only for [conjuncts](Defs#conjuncts).  It provides a link to the definition of each of the conjunct's parts.

### <a name="meta"></a>Meta

The `meta` section documents the [normalized](Normalization) tags for the definition's representation as a dict.  Each tag present in the definition is listed here, although some values such as the `doc` or `enum` may reference another section.

### <a name="usage"></a>Usage

This section is used only on entity terms.  It lists the required marker tags that must be applied to a dict to correctly [implement](Reflection#implementation) the term.  It takes into account conjuncts and supertypes with the [mandatory](mandatory) marker.

### <a name="enum"></a>Enum

If the definition has the [enum](enum) tag, then this section provides a listing of the documented enumerations and their summary.

### <a name="supertypes"></a>Supertypes

This section lists the term's [supertypes](Subtyping).  The supertypes are organized as an indented tree down from most general to most specific. The first item is the root type, which is typically [marker](marker) or [val](val).  The last item will be the definition's declared supertype matching the [is](is) tag. If the term has multiple supertypes, then this tree will have multiple leaves.

### <a name="subtypes"></a>Subtypes

This section lists the term's [subtypes](Subtyping).  The subtypes are organized in an indented tree structure.

### <a name="tags"></a>Tags

This section lists the value tags associated with the entity via the [tagOn](tagOn) association.  This section also includes tags that are registered on the entity's supertypes.

### <a name="children"></a>Children

This section lists children [prototypes](Protos) that are "contained" by the given entity type.

## <a name="protos"></a>Protos

Prototypes are dict instances that model a predefined collection of tags.

### <a name="proto"></a>Proto

The `proto` section defines the prototypes tags.

### <a name="implements"></a>Implements

The definitions [implemented](Reflection#implementation) by the prototype.
