## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

This chapter covers plants used to produce thermal energy for cooling or heating.  Haystack standardizes the following types of plants:

* [chilled-water-plant](chilled-water-plant): produces chilled water for cooling
* [hot-water-plant](hot-water-plant): produces hot water for heating
* [steam-plant](steam-plant): produces steam water


Typically, these plants supply [AHUs](AHUs) and [VAVs](VAVs) for HVAC applications.  But they can also be used for industrial processes.

We typically use the term *central plant* to describe a plant that supplies a building or group of buildings.  When the plant supplies a municipality, we use the term *district plant*.  However, the Haystack modeling techniques described here are identical.

Haystack models an entire plant as a single blackbox [equip](equip) entity. Equipment within the plant, including heat exchangers, pumps, boilers, and chillers, are modeled as children of the plant via the [equipRef](equipRef) tag.

## <a name="chilledWaterPlants"></a>Chilled Water Plants

Chilled water plants are modeled as a single black box using the [chilled-water-plant](chilled-water-plant) conjunct along with the [equip](equip) tag.  These plants are composed of the following types of sub-equipment:

* [chiller](chiller)
* [coolingTower](coolingTower)
* [heatExchanger](heatExchanger)
* [pump-motor](pump-motor)
* [valve-actuator](valve-actuator)


This diagram shows the salient equipment and fluid flows:

## <a name="hotWaterPlants"></a>Hot Water Plants

Hot water plants are modeled using the [hot-water-plant](hot-water-plant) conjunct along with the [equip](equip) tag.  These plants are composed of the following types of sub-equipment:

* [hot-water-boiler](hot-water-boiler)
* [heatExchanger](heatExchanger)
* [pump-motor](pump-motor)
* [valve-actuator](valve-actuator)


## <a name="steamPlants"></a>Steam Plants

Steam plants are modeled using the [steam-plant](steam-plant) conjunct along with the [equip](equip) tag.  These plants are composed of the following types of sub-equipment:

* [steam-boiler](steam-boiler)
* [heatExchanger](heatExchanger)
* [pump-motor](pump-motor)
* [valve-actuator](valve-actuator)


## <a name="loops"></a>Loops

Plants typically maintain a separation between the working fluid within the plant versus the fluid that supplies thermal energy to the building. We term the pipework within the central plant the [primaryLoop](primaryLoop) and the pipework from the plant to the building the [secondaryLoop](secondaryLoop).  These two loops are connected through [heat exchangers](heatExchanger).  In the case of a third loop connected to the second loop through a second set of heat exchangers we use the term [tertiaryLoop](tertiaryLoop).

For example, here is how we would model a heat exchanger with a temperature sensor on the primary entering pipe and on the secondary leaving pipe:

    id: @hx
    dis: "Heat Exchanger"
    chilled
    water
    heatExchanger
    equip
    equipRef: @plant

    id: @primary-temp
    dis: "Primary Entering Temp Sensor"
