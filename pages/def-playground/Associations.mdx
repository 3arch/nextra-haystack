## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Associations define ontological relationships between defs.  An [association](association) is a tag used on defs to cross-reference related defs via symbols.  We use the term *association* to denote def-to-def relationships versus instance data [relationships](Relationships), which utilize ref tags.

Associations are def tags where the value is a list of symbols. Most foundational def relationships are associations including:

* [is](is): defines supertypes used to build taxonomy tree
* [tagOn](tagOn): annotates a tag to be used with a given type


In the following example both `is` and `tagOn` are associations which create a relationship between defs:

    def: ^yearBuilt
    is: ^number
    tagOn: ^site

As a convenience, association tags can use as a simple symbol value.  But, they are always [normalized](Normalization#normalizeTags) to a list.  Association tags are never used on instance data; they are strictly used only on defs.

## <a name="reciprocalOf"></a>Reciprocal Of

The [reciprocalOf](reciprocalOf) tag is applied to an association to define its inverse term. For example:

* [tags](tags) is reciprocalOf of [tagOn](tagOn) (and vice versa)
* [quantities](quantities) is reciprocalOf of [quantityOf](quantityOf) (and vice versa)


Reciprocals are used to coin terms that are intuitive for bi-directional [relationship queries](Relationships#reciprocalOf).  However, to promote consistency, it is desirable to only declare associations in one direction. Typically, "child-to-parent" is the preferred direction for declaring associations. For example, it is more convenient to declare `tagOn` for value tags than to enumerate all the `tags` for a given entity type.  This design also provides more flexibility for late binding of associations in separate libs. We use the [computed](computed) tag to capture this concept.  For example, [tags](tags) is annotated with the `computed` marker.  This means its `tags` must be not used directly as a def tag (it exists only to provide an inverse term for `tagOn`).
