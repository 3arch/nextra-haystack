## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

Spaces are modeled with the [space](space) marker tag.  Spaces include the physical structure of buildings including [floors](floor) and [rooms](room).  Spaces also encompass logical system-oriented [zones](zone-space) for HVAC, lighting, security, smoke/fire, etc.

## <a name="tags"></a>Tags

All spaces must define a [siteRef](siteRef) tag for their parent site.  In addition, when spaces are wholly contained by another space, they should model that relationship via the [spaceRef](spaceRef) tag.

## <a name="floors"></a>Floors

If a building has multiple floors, then each floor should be modeled using the [floor](floor) and [space](space) marker tags.  Floors are numbered using the [floorNum](floorNum) tag using the European convention where the ground floor is always floor zero. Subterranean floors are numbered using negative numbers.  Here are examples for the proper modeling of floors:

    // ground floor; typically called first floor in the US
    id: @site.floor1
    dis: "Ground Floor"
    ground
    floor
    space
    floorNum: 0
    siteRef: @site
    
    // basement floor
    id: @site.basement
    dis: "Basement Level 1"
    subterranean
    floor
    space
    floorNum: -1
    siteRef: @site
    
    // roofs are modeled as a special floor
    id: @site.roof
    dis: "Roof level of two story building"
    roof
    floor
    space
    floorNum: 2
    siteRef: @site

## <a name="zones"></a>Zones

Zones are system oriented spaces.  Currently we define the following zone types:

* [hvac-zone-space](hvac-zone-space): heating/cooling/ventilation zones
* [lighting-zone-space](lighting-zone-space): lighting zones


Here is an example of an HVAC zone:

    id: @site.zone3B
    dis: "VAV Zone 3-B"
    hvac
    zone
    space
    siteRef: @site
    spaceRef: @site.floor3

Zones, and their associated points, are examined in detail in the [Zones](Zones) chapter.

Data centers are also modeled as a subtype of space. See the [DataCenters](DataCenters) chapter for details.
