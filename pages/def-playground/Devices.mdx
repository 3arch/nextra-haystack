## <a name="overview"></a>Overview

We use the term *device* to describe any asset that is microprocessor based. Typically, this includes most IT and networking gear, but also includes microprocessor based controllers commonly used to perform control and monitoring of equipment.

There can often be a fuzzy distinction between equipment versus devices, especially since most point data for an equipment is manifested through a controller.  However when building a detailed model of a control system, use an [equip](equip) entity to represent the physical asset and use a separate [device](device) entity to represent the controller.  In cases where the distinction is not clear, then combine the [equip](equip) and [device](device) tags into one entity.

Networks are modeled with the [network](network) tag.  Devices on a network should model their network relationship with the [networkRef](networkRef) tag.

Devices where the main function is networking should subtype from the [networking-device](networking-device) conjuct.  Haystack defines the following networking device types:

* [networking-router](networking-router): device used to route data between different networks
* [networking-switch](networking-switch): device used to connect devices on the same network


Here is a simple example of a network model that includes a switch with two controllers:

    id: @my-network
    dis: "Simple Local Network"
    network
    
    id: @my-switch
    dis: "Network Switch"
    networking
    switch
    device
    networkRef: @my-network
    
    id: @my-controller-1
    dis: "Controller 1"
    controller
    device
    networkRef: @my-network
    
    id: @my-controller-2
    dis: "Controller 2"
    controller
    device
    networkRef: @my-network
