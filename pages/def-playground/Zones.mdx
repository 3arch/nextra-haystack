This chapter provides the details for modeling zones and their associated sensors and setpoints.  See the [Spaces#zones](Spaces#zones) chapter for an introduction to how zones are modeled as a subtype of space.

## <a name="occupancy"></a>Occupancy

Determining and controlling occupancy is one of the most critical aspects of building automation.  Haystack defines several occupancy related tags and points:

* [occupied](occupied) [sp](sp): setpoint true when occupied, false when unoccupied
* [occupied](occupied) [sensor](sensor): boolean sensor true when occupied, false when unoccupied
* [occupancy](occupancy) [sensor](sensor): people counter that measures number of occupants
* [occ](occ): marker tag is used on points for occupancy modes
* [unocc](unocc): marker tag is used on points for occupancy modes
* [occupants](occupants): the people who occupy a space


The primary tag used for the occupied/unoccupied state is the [occupied](occupied) tag. In most cases, the occupied setpoint is a schedule that determines occupancy based on the time of day and day of the week.  We might also use a sensor like a motion sensor to determine occupancy. More sophisticated sensors can actually count the number of people in a space; in which case, we use the [occupancy](occupancy) tag.  As a general rule: points with the [occupied](occupied) tag should have a `Bool` kind; points with the [occupancy](occupancy) tag should have a `Number` kind.

The [occ](occ) and [unocc](unocc) tags are used in cases when we need to distinguish modes.  For example, if we have two different temperature setpoints based on the occupancy mode, then we distinguish them as `occ temp sp` and `unocc temp sp`.

## <a name="hvac"></a>HVAC

The [hvac-zone-space](hvac-zone-space) conjunct models an HVAC zone for the conditioning of space comfort and air quality.  The [hvacZonePoints](hvacZonePoints) def enumerates the common points used for HVAC control of a space.

The sensor and setpoints associated with temperature control include:

* [hvacMode](hvacMode) [sp](sp): current mode such as "cooling" or "heating"
* [temp](temp) [sensor](sensor): actual sensed temperature of the space
* [temp](temp) [occ](occ) [cooling](cooling) [sp](sp): cooling setpoint when occupied
* [temp](temp) [occ](occ) [heating](heating) [sp](sp): heating setpoint when occupied
* [temp](temp) [unocc](unocc) [cooling](cooling) [sp](sp): cooling setpoint when unoccupied
* [temp](temp) [unocc](unocc) [heating](heating) [sp](sp): heating setpoint when unoccupied
* [temp](temp) [standby](standby) [cooling](cooling) [sp](sp): cooling setpoint when in standby mode
* [temp](temp) [standby](standby) [heating](heating) [sp](sp): heating setpoint when in standby mode
* [temp](temp) [effective](effective) [sp](sp): current setpoint we are controlling to taking into account cooling/heating mode and occ/unocc/standby mode


Whenever possible, there should be one effective temperature setpoint that takes all the various modes into account.  This provides the simplest model to perform analysis of HVAC operations.  However in some cases a thermostat will provide two effective setpoints - one for cooling and one for heating.  In this case, there must also be a `hvacMode` point to determine which one is the true effective setpoint.  That setup should look like this:

* [hvacMode](hvacMode) [sp](sp)
* [temp](temp) [effective](effective) [cooling](cooling) [sp](sp)
* [temp](temp) [effective](effective) [heating](heating) [sp](sp)


In addition, we might also find the following points:

* [pressure](pressure) [sensor](sensor): measured static pressure of the space
* [pressure](pressure) [sp](sp): static pressure setpoint (commonly used for lab situations)
* [humidity](humidity) [sensor](sensor): measured relative humidity of the space
* [humidity](humidity) [sp](sp): setpoint for relative humidity
* [dewPoint](dewPoint) [sensor](sensor): measured dew point temperature of the space
* [dewPoint](dewPoint) [sp](sp): setpoint for dew point temperature
* [enthalpy](enthalpy) [sensor](sensor): measured heat content of the space


All the points above must also be tagged with [zone](zone), [air](air), and [point](point).

## <a name="airQuality"></a>Air Quality

It is also common in an HVAC zone to also measure and control air quality. We model the typical air quality points using the [airQualityZonePoints](airQualityZonePoints) def which includes:

* [ch2o-concentration](ch2o-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured formaldehyde (CH₂O)
* [co-concentration](co-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured carbon monoxide (CO)
* [co2-concentration](co2-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured carbon dioxide (CO₂)
* [co2-concentration](co2-concentration) [sp](sp): configured max carbon dioxide (CO₂)
* [nh3-concentration](nh3-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured ammonia (NH₃)
* [no2-concentration](no2-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)
* [o3-concentration](o3-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured ozone (O₃)
* [pm01-concentration](pm01-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured particulate matter 0.1
* [pm25-concentration](pm25-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured particulate matter 2.5
* [pm10-concentration](pm10-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured particulate matter 10
* [tvoc-concentration](tvoc-concentration) [sensor](sensor): measured total volatile organic compounds


All the points above must also be tagged with [zone](zone), [air](air), and [point](point).

## <a name="lighting"></a>Lighting

The [lighting-zone-space](lighting-zone-space) conjuct models lighting zones.  The [lightingZonePoints](lightingZonePoints) def enumerates the typical points used for lighting measurement and control including:

* [light-level](light-level) [sensor](sensor): brightness level status as percentage
* [light-level](light-level) [sp](sp): brightness level setpoint as percentage
* [light](light) [illuminance](illuminance) [sensor](sensor): lux, footcandle, or phot
* [light](light) [luminous-flux](luminous-flux) [sensor](sensor): luminous flux in lumens
