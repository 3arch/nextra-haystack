# Project Haystack Documentation

Project Haystack is an open source initiative to develop a common data model and tagging conventions for building automation and industrial control systems. The goal of the project is to make it easier to analyze and understand data from these systems, and to facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications.

        **Vocabulary**
        
        Refers to the set of words and phrases used to describe a particular subject or 
        area of expertise. In the context of Project Haystack, a **def** refers to terms and tags 
        used to describe data in a consistent and meaningful way.

    <Card  decoration="top" decorationColor="blue" style={{width: "50%"}}>   
        **Taxonomy** 
        
        Refers to the practice of classifying things into categories and subcategories, 
        soften for the purpose of organization and navigation. Here, taxonomy refers to the way 
        in which data is organized and categorized using the **subtype** and **supertype** relationships.

        **Ontology** 
        
        Refers to the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of being and existence. In the 
        context of Project Haystack, ontology refers to the way in which data is modeled and the relationships 
        between different data points. There are many different asociations that might come up between defs, for 
        example **airRef**, **elecRef**, **chillerRef**, etc.
