# Project Haystack

Project Haystack is an open source initiative to develop a common data model and tagging conventions for building automation and industrial control systems. The goal of the project is to make it easier to analyze and understand data from these systems, and to facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications.

## Understanding Taxonomy, Ontology, and Vocabulary

- Taxonomy refers to the practice of classifying things into categories and subcategories, often for the purpose of organization and navigation. In the context of Project Haystack, taxonomy refers to the way in which data is organized and categorized.

- Ontology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of being and existence. In the context of Project Haystack, ontology refers to the way in which data is modeled and the relationships between different data points.

- Vocabulary refers to the set of words and phrases used to describe a particular subject or area of expertise. In the context of Project Haystack, vocabulary refers to the set of terms and tags used to describe data in a consistent and meaningful way.
