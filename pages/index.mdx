# Haystack Docs

Project-Haystack has created Haystack 4.0 in order to not only define entities themselves, but define their structure and relationships as well.

## What is Vocabulary, Ontology, and Taxonomy? 

### Vocabulary

Vocabulary refers to the words and terms that are used in a specific field or subject area. It is the set of terms and definitions that are used to communicate and understand concepts within that field.

Example: AHU, Meter, VAV, etc

### Taxonomy

Taxonomy is the practice of classifying and organizing things into a hierarchy or system. In the context of biology, taxonomy is the science of classifying and naming living organisms according to their characteristics and evolutionary relationships. 
In information science, taxonomy refers to the practice of organizing and categorizing content in a logical and hierarchical manner. Project Haystack defines this heirarchy with Supertypes and Subtypes, creating a parent/child tree with the PHIoT Entities.

Example: Entity -> Equip -> airHandlingEquip -> AHU 


### Ontology

Ontology refers to a formal representation of the concepts and relationships within a specific domain of knowledge. An ontology is a set of concepts and categories in a domain, and the relationships between them. It is used to represent the structure and meaning of knowledge in a particular area, and to facilitate the exchange of information between systems.
