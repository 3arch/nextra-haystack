# Welcome to the Developer Documentation

Welcome to Project Haystack!

As a developer, you may be familiar with the challenge of working with data from building automation and industrial control systems. Project Haystack aims to make this easier by developing a common data model and tagging conventions. This will make it easier to analyze and understand data from these systems and facilitate interoperability between different systems and applications.

One of the key concepts in Project Haystack is vocabulary, which refers to the set of terms used to describe the data. Another important concept is taxonomy, which is the organization and structure of the vocabulary. Additionally, ontology is the formal representation of the relationships and associations between the terms in the vocabulary.

In Project Haystack, these concepts are used to define points, which are the basic unit of data, and defs, which are used to describe points. By using a consistent vocabulary and taxonomy, developers can easily navigate and interact with data from different systems.

As you dive into the developer documentation, you will learn about the detailed information on the data model, tagging conventions, code examples and tutorials, API reference, and advanced topics. The goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to integrate Project Haystack into your existing systems and applications.
