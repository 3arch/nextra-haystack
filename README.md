# nextra-haystack
Nextra codebase for new Haystack Documentation

To get started locally, clone the repo and run 'pnpm i' to install dependencies.

To run application, run 'pnpm next' and open browser to localhost:3000

The main branch is being deployed to Vercel so you can safely pull/commit/push without affecting the "production" app as long as you create a new branch. All commits to the main branch will auto-deploy onto the vercel application located at https://nextra-haystack.vercel.app/
